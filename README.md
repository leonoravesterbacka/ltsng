## London Tube Station Name Generator

This is the London Tube Station Name Generator! 
Inspired by the sometimes hilarious names of the London underground system. It's a Tensorflow RNN that can generate new names from a given input first letter, using a model trained to learn the specific order of letters following a certain letter. 

The results are hilarious, and I generate them solely for my own amusement.
